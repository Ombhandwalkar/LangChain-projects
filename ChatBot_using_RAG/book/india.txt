Theearliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000years ago.
Sedentariness
began in South Asia around 7000BCE; by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread,

and graduallyevolved into the
Indus Valley Civilisation
, one of three early
cradles of civilisation
in the
Old World
,
[

[

]
which flourishedbetween 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan andnorth-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE,
persistent drought
caused the population of the Indus Valley toscatter from large urban centres to villages.
Indo-Aryan tribes
moved into the
Punjab
from
Central Asia
in several
waves ofmigration
. The
Vedic Period
of the Vedic people in northernIndia (1500–500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their extensive collections of hymns(
Vedas
). The social structure was loosely stratified via the
varna system
, incorporated into thehighly evolved present-day
Jāti
system. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from thePunjab into the
Gangetic plain
. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, smallchieftaincies (
janapadas
) were consolidated into larger states (
mahajanapadas
). Secondurbanization took place, which came with the rise of new
ascetic
movements and religiousconcepts,
[

]
including the rise of
Jainism
and
Buddhism
. The latter
was synthesized
with thepreexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to
Hinduism
.
Chandragupta Maurya
overthrew the
Nanda Empire
andestablished the first great empire in ancient India, the
MauryaEmpire
. India's Mauryan king
Ashoka
is widely recognised forhis historical acceptance of
Buddhism
and his attempts tospread
nonviolence
and
peace
across his empire. The MauryaEmpire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of thethen-emperor
Brihadratha
by his general
Pushyamitra Shunga
.Shunga would form the
Shunga Empire
in the north and north-east of the subcontinent, while the
Greco-Bactrian Kingdom
would claim the north-west and found the
Indo-GreekKingdom
. Various parts of India were ruled by numerousdynasties, including the
Gupta Empire
, in the 4th to 6thcenturies CE. This period, witnessing a
Hindu
religious andintellectual resurgence is known as the
Classical
or
Golden Ageof India
. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture,and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to theestablishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming
Greater India

Bengal Sultanate
also emerged as a major power, lasting over threecenturies.
[

During this period, multiple strong Hindu kingdoms, notably the

The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the

[

The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early18th century, largely due to the rising power of the

The
East India Company

company rule in India
led to the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
. India was afterwards ruled directly bythe
British Crown
, in the
British Raj
. After
World War I
, a nationwide struggle for independencewas launched by the
Indian National Congress
, led by
Mahatma Gandhi
. Later, the
All-IndiaMuslim League
would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority
nation state
. The British IndianEmpire was partitioned in August 1947 into the
Dominion of India
and
Dominion of Pakistan
, eachgaining its independence.

The oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of

Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent byhominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespreadby approximately 250,000 years ago.

According to a historical demographer of South Asia,Tim Dyson:
Modern human beings—
Homo sapiens
—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently,sometime between 60,000 and 80,000years ago, tiny groups of them began toenter the north-west of the Indiansubcontinent. It seems likely that initiallythey came by way of the coast. It isvirtually certain that there were
Homosapiens
in the subcontinent 55,000 yearsago, even though the earliest fossils thathave been found of them date to onlyabout 30,000 years before the present.
[
31

According to Michael D. Petraglia and
BridgetAllchin
:
Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA datasupport the colonisation of South Asia bymodern humans originating in Africa. ...Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between73–55 ka.
[
32
]
Historian of South Asia,
Michael H. Fisher
, states:
Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyondAfrica and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago toas late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessfulemigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in eachgeneration, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channelwas along the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northernIndian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and35,000 years ago.
[
33
]
Archaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of
anatomically modernhumans
in the Indian subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago,
[
34
]
although this interpretation isdisputed.
[
35

[
36
]
The occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms ofisolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa inhuman genetic diversity.
[

According to Tim Dyson:

Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent'speople in other respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region isextremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related tothis, there is strong evidence of 'founder' events in the subcontinent. By this is meantcircumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent'speople are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels ofendogamy.
[

Settled life
emerged on the subcontinent in the westernmargins of the
Indus River
alluvium approximately 9,000years ago, evolving gradually into the
Indus Valley Civilisation
of the third millennium BCE.
[

[
39
]
According to Tim Dyson:"By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established inBaluchistan... [and] slowly spread eastwards into the Indusvalley." Michael Fisher adds:
[
40
]
The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is atMehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass andthe Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1).From as early as 7000 BCE, communities therestarted investing increased labor in preparing theland and selecting, planting, tending, andharvesting particular grain-producing plants. Theyalso domesticated animals, including sheep, goats,pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [
Bos indicus
]and unhumped [
Bos taurus
]). Castrating oxen, forinstance, turned them from mainly meat sourcesinto domesticated draft-animals as well.
[
40
]
The
Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent
began around 3300 BCE.
The Indus Valley region wasone of three early
cradles of civilisation
in the
Old World
; the Indus Valley civilisation was the mostexpansive,
[
3
]
and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million.
[
4
]
The civilisation was primarily centred in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, andsecondarily in the
Ghaggar-Hakra River
basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. Itincluded cities such as
Harappa
,
Ganweriwal
, and
Mohenjo-daro
in modern-day Pakistan, and
Dholavira

Inhabitants of the ancient Indus River valley, the Harappans,developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft, andproduced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.
[

The civilisation isnoted for its cities built of brick, and its roadside drainagesystems, and is thought to have had some kind of municipalorganisation. The civilisation also developed an
Indus script

This is the reason why

The
Vedic period
is when the Vedas were composed of liturgicalhymns from the Indo-Aryan people. The Vedic culture waslocated in part of north-west India, while other parts of Indiahad a distinct cultural identity. Many regions of the Indiansubcontinent transitioned from the
Chalcolithic
to the
Iron Age
in this period.
[

The Vedic culture is described in the texts of
Vedas

Vedic Sanskrit

The Vedic period, lastingfrom about 1500 to 500 BCE,

in the north-western region of theIndian subcontinent.
[

At this time, Aryan society consistedof predominantly tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from theHarappan urbanisation which had been abandoned.

Theearly Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, tothe
Ochre Coloured Pottery culture

[

[
62
]
At the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society expandedfrom the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent intothe western
Ganges
plain. It became increasinglyagricultural and was socially organised around thehierarchy of the four
varnas
, or social classes. This socialstructure was characterised both by syncretising with thenative cultures of northern India
[
63
]
but also eventuallyby the exclusion of some indigenous peoples by labellingtheir occupations impure.
[
64
]
During this period, many ofthe previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began tocoalesce into
Janapadas
(monarchical, state-levelpolities).
[

The Sanskrit epics
Ramayana
and
Mahabharata
werecomposed during this period.
[

The
Mahabharata
remains the longest single poem in the world.

Historiansformerly postulated an "epic age" as the milieu of these twoepic poems, but now recognise that the texts went throughmultiple stages of development over centuries.

c.
400 BCE and 400 CE.

The
Iron Age
in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCEto the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are

The

[
72
]
as well as with the composition of the
Atharvaveda
.
[
73

The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymnsinto collections and developed the

Two key figures ofthe Kuru state were king
Parikshit
and his successor

The later part ofthis period corresponds with a consolidation of increasinglylarge states and kingdoms, called

The period between 800 and 200 BCE saw the formation of the
Śramaṇa
movement, from which
Jainism
and
Buddhism
originated. The first
Upanishads
were written during thisperiod. After 500 BCE, the so-called "secondurbanisation"
[

started, with new urban settlementsarising at the Ganges plain.
[
76

The foundations for the"second urbanisation" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the
Painted Grey Ware culture
of the
Ghaggar-Hakra
andUpper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were smallfarming villages, "several dozen" PGW sites eventuallyemerged as relatively large settlements that can becharacterised as towns, the largest of which were fortifiedby ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earthwith wooden palisades.

Magadha formed one of the sixteen

Bihar
south of the

Rajagriha
(modernRajgir) then
Pataliputra
(modern

Licchavi
and
Anga
respectively,

Theearliest reference to the Magadhapeople occurs in the
Atharva-Veda
where they are found listed along with the
Angas
,
Gandharis
,and Mujavats. Magadha played an important role in the development of
Jainism
and
Buddhism
.Republican communities (such as the community of Rajakumara) are merged into Magadhakingdom. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Theiradministrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.
Early sources, from the Buddhist
Pāli Canon

Bimbisara
of the
Haryanka dynasty
led an active and expansivepolicy, conquering Anga in what is now eastern Bihar and
West Bengal
. King Bimbisara wasoverthrown and killed by his son, Prince
Ajatashatru

The Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE)unified most of the Indiansubcontinent into one state, and wasthe
largest empire
ever to exist on theIndian subcontinent.
[

At itsgreatest extent, the Mauryan Empirestretched to the north up to the naturalboundaries of the
Himalayas
and tothe east into what is now
Assam
. Tothe west, it reached beyond modernPakistan, to the
Hindu Kush
mountains in what is now Afghanistan.The empire was established by
Chandragupta Maurya
assisted by Chanakya (
Kautilya
) in
Magadha
(in modern
Bihar
) when he overthrew the
Nanda Empire
.
[
107

Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, and by317 BCE the empire had fully occupied north-western India. The Mauryan Empire defeated
Seleucus I
, founder of the
Seleucid Empire
, during the
Seleucid–Mauryan war
, thus gainedadditional territory west of the Indus River. Chandragupta's son
Bindusara
succeeded to the thronearound 297 BCE. By the time he died in
c.
272 BCE, a large part of the Indian subcontinent wasunder Mauryan suzerainty. However, the region of
Kalinga
(around modern day
Odisha
) remainedoutside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with trade with the south.
[

Bindusara was succeeded by
Ashoka
, whose reign lasted untilhis death in about 232 BCE.
[

His campaign against theKalingans in about 260 BCE, though successful, led toimmense loss of life and misery. This led Ashoka to shunviolence, and subsequently to embrace Buddhism.

Under Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal andexternal trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrivedand expanded across India thanks to the creation of a singleefficient system of finance, administration, and security. TheMauryans built the

Pushyamitra Shunga ruled for 36 years and was succeeded by his son
Agnimitra
. There were tenShunga rulers. However, after the death of Agnimitra, the empire rapidly disintegrated;
[
130
]
inscriptions and coins indicate that much of northern and central India consisted of smallkingdoms and city-states that were independent of any Shunga hegemony.

Mahameghavahana dynasty

Kalinga

Satavahana dynasty
of
Deccan
, the
Indo-Greeks
, andpossibly the
Panchalas

Art, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period includingarchitectural monuments such as the Stupa at
Bharhut
and the renowned Great Stupa at
Sanchi
.The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. Thescript used by the empire was a variant of
Brahmi
and was used to write the
Sanskrit language
. TheShunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising
Indian culture
at a time when some of themost important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.
The Śātavāhanas were based from
Amaravati
in
Andhra Pradesh
as well as
Junnar
(
Pune
) andPrathisthan (
Paithan
) in
Maharashtra
. The territory of the empire covered large parts of India fromthe 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the
Mauryan dynasty
,but declared independence with its decline.
The Sātavāhanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted inBuddhist monuments from
Ellora
(a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
) to
Amaravati
. They were oneof the first Indian states to issue coins with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridgeand played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the
Indo-Gangetic Plain
to the southern tip of India.
They had to compete with the
Shunga Empire
and then the
Kanva dynasty
of
Magadha
to establishtheir rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaderslike the

, during the 4th to 9th centuries were, alongsidethe
Guptas
of the
North
, great patronisers of Sanskritdevelopment in the
South
of the Indian subcontinent. ThePallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a scriptcalled
Grantha
.
[

Early Pallavas had different connexions to
Southeast Asian
countries. The Pallavas used Dravidianarchitecture to build some very important Hindu temples andacademies in
Mamallapuram
,
Kanchipuram
and other places;their rule saw the rise of great poets. The practice of dedicatingtemples to different deities came into vogue followed by fineartistic
temple architecture
and sculpture style of
VastuShastra
.
[

Pallavas reached the height of power during the reign of
Mahendravarman I
(571–630 CE) and
Narasimhavarman I
(630–668 CE) and dominated the
Telugu
and northern parts ofthe

region until the end of the 9th century.

Kadambas originated from

Mayurasharma
in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperialproportions. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of
Pallavas of Kanchi
possibly with help ofsome native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of
Kakusthavarma
, anotable ruler with whom the kings of
Gupta Dynasty
of northern India cultivated marital alliances.The Kadambas were contemporaries of the
Western Ganga Dynasty
and together they formed theearliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued torule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the
Chalukya
and the
Rashtrakuta
empires, for overfive hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties (

,
Kadambas of Halasi

ruled northern India from 606 to 647 CE. He was theson of

After the downfall of the prior
Gupta Empire
in the middle ofthe 6th century,
North India
reverted to smaller republics andmonarchical states. The power vacuum resulted in the rise ofthe Vardhanas of Thanesar, who began uniting the republicsand monarchies from the Punjab to central India. After thedeath of Harsha's father and brother, representatives of theempire crowned Harsha emperor in April 606 CE, givinghim the title of Maharaja.

The

Kadamba
kingdom of
Banavasi
and rapidly rose toprominence during the reign of
Pulakeshin II
. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an importantmilestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of
Karnataka
. The politicalatmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy ofBadami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entireregion between the
Kaveri
and the
Narmada Rivers
. The rise of this empire saw the birth ofefficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style ofarchitecture called "Chalukyan architecture". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern andcentral India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from

The late medieval period is marked by repeated invasions by Muslim Central Asian nomadicclans,
[
224
]
[
225
]
the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, and by the growth of other states, built uponmilitary technology of the sultanate.
[
226
]
The Delhi Sultanate was a series of successive Islamic states based in Delhi, ruled by severaldynasties of varying origins. The polity ruled over large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the13th to early 16th centuries.
[
227
]
The sultanate was founded in the 12th and 13th centuries byCentral Asian Turks, who invaded parts of northern India and established the state atop formerHindu holdings.
[
228
]
The subsequent
Mamluk dynasty
of Delhi managed to conquer large areas ofnorthern India. The
Khalji dynasty
conquered much of central India while forcing the principalHindu kingdoms of South India to become
vassal states
.
[
227
]
The sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting "Indo-Muslim"fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, andclothing. It is surmised that the language of
Urdu
was born during the period of the DelhiSultanate. The sultanate was the only Indo-Islamic state to enthrone one of the few female rulers inIndia,
Razia Sultana
(
r.
1236–1240
).
While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslimelites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growingworld system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact onIndian culture and society.
[
229
]
However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destructionand desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.
[
230
]
The
Mongol invasions of India
were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate during the rule of
Alauddin Khalji
. A major factor in their success was their Turkic
Mamluk
slave army, who werehighly skilled in the same style of nomadic cavalry warfare as the Mongols. It is possible that theMongol Empire may have expanded into India were it not for the Delhi Sultanate's role in repellingthem.
[
231
]
By repeatedly repulsing the Mongol raiders,
[
232
]
the sultanate saved India from thedevastation waged on West and Central Asia. Soldiers from that region and learned men andadministrators fleeing Mongol invasions of Iran migrated into the subcontinent, thereby creating asyncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.
[
231
]
A
Turco-Mongol
conqueror from Central Asia,
Timur
(Tamerlane), attacked the reigning sultan
Nasir-u Din Mehmud
of the
Tughlaq dynasty
in Delhi.
[
233
]
The sultan's army was defeated on 17December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins afterTimur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to besacked except for the
sayyids
, scholars, and the "other Muslims" (artists); 100,000 war prisonerswere said to have been put to death in one day.
[
234
]
The sultanate suffered significantly from thesacking of Delhi. Though revived briefly under the
Sayyid
and
Lodi
dynasties, it was but a shadowof the former. Lodi rule lasted in Delhi until the defeat of the last sultan,
Ibrahim Khan Lodi
,
in1526
to the forces of
Babur

The Vijayanagara Empire was established in 1336 by
Harihara I
and his brother
Bukka Raya I

which originated as a political heir of the
Hoysala Empire
,
Kakatiya Empire
,

and the

.
[
238

The empire rose to prominence as aculmination of attempts by the south Indian powers toward off
Islamic invasions
by the end of the 13th century. Itlasted until 1646, although its power declined after a majormilitary defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the
Deccan sultanates
. The empire is named after its capitalcity of
Vijayanagara
, whose ruins surround present day
Hampi
, now a

In the first two decades after the founding of the empire,Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the titleof
Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara
("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 BukkaRaya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of
Arcot
, the
Reddys
of Kondavidu, andthe
Sultan of Madurai
and had gained control over
Goa
in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna
doab
in the north.

Harihara II
, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the
KrishnaRiver
and brought the whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella.

The next ruler,
Deva Raya I
, emerged successful against the
Gajapatis
of Odisha and undertook important worksof fortification and irrigation.

For two and a half centuries from the mid-13th century, politics in Northern India was dominatedby the
Delhi Sultanate
, and in Southern India by the Vijayanagar Empire. However, there wereother regional powers present as well. After fall of Pala Empire, the

Kanchi
in the south, eventually being absorbed into the expanding VijayanagaraEmpire.
[

In the north, the
Rajput kingdoms
remained the dominant force in Western and Central India. The
Mewar dynasty
under
Maharana Hammir
defeated and captured
Muhammad Tughlaq
with theBargujars as his main allies. Tughlaq had to pay a huge ransom and relinquish all of Mewar'slands. After this event, the Delhi Sultanate did not attack Chittor for a few hundred years. TheRajputs re-established their independence, and Rajput states were established as far east as Bengaland north into the
Punjab
. The
Tomaras
established themselves at
Gwalior
, and
Man Singh Tomar
reconstructed the
Gwalior Fort

Battle of Khanwa
consolidated the new
Mughal dynasty
in India.

The Mewar dynastyunder Maharana
Udai Singh II
faced further defeat by Mughal emperor

Udaipur
, which became the newcapital of the
Mewar kingdom

The
Sultanate of Bengal
was the dominant power of the
Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta
, with anetwork of mint towns spread across the region. It was a
Sunni Muslim
monarchy with Indo-Turkic, Arab, Abyssinian and
Bengali Muslim
elites. The sultanate was known for its religiouspluralism where non-Muslim communities co-existed peacefully. The Bengal Sultanate had a circleof
vassal states
, including
Odisha
in the southwest,
Arakan
in the southeast, and
Tripura
in theeast. In the early 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate reached the peak of its territorial growth withcontrol over
Kamrup
and
Kamata
in the northeast and
Jaunpur
and
Bihar
in the west. It wasreputed as a thriving trading nation and one of Asia's strongest states. The Bengal Sultanate wasdescribed by contemporary European and Chinese visitors as a relatively prosperous kingdom andthe "richest country to trade with". The Bengal Sultanate left a strong architectural legacy.Buildings from the period show foreign influences merged into a distinct
Bengali style.
The BengalSultanate was also the largest and most prestigious authority among the independent medievalMuslim-ruled states in the
history of Bengal
. Its decline began with an
interregnum
by the
SuriEmpire
, followed by
Mughal
conquest
and disintegration into petty kingdoms.

Maharaja Ranjit Singh
(1780–1839).
Maharaja Ranjit Singh consolidated much of northern India into an empire using his
Sikh KhalsaArmy

Himachal

Anglo-Mysore Wars
took place, where theMysoreans used the
Mysorean rockets
. The
Fourth Anglo-Mysore War
(1798–1799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore'salliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British EastIndia Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides.The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched aninvasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory atthe
Siege of Seringapatam (1799)

Hyderabad was founded by the
Qutb Shahi dynasty
of
Golconda
in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, aMughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declaredhimself
Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad
in 1724. The Nizams lostconsiderable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empireafter being routed in multiple battles, such as the
Battle ofPalkhed
.

However, the Nizams maintained theirsovereignty from 1724 until 1948 through paying tributes to the Marathas, and later, being vassalsof the British.
Hyderabad State
became a princely state in British India in 1798.
The
Nawabs of Bengal
had become the de facto rulers of Bengal following the decline of MughalEmpire. However, their rule was interrupted by Marathas who carried out
six expeditions inBengal
from 1741 to 1748, as a result of which Bengal became a tributary state of Marathas. On 23June 1757,
Siraj ud-Daulah
, the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the
Battle ofPlassey
by
Mir Jafar
. He lost to the British, who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757, installedMir Jafar on the
Masnad
(throne) and established itself to a political power in Bengal.

In 1765the system of Dual Government was established, in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of theBritish and were mere puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal wasbrought under the direct control of the British. In 1793, when the
Nizamat

In the 18th century, the whole of Rajputana was virtually subdued by the Marathas. The
SecondAnglo-Maratha War
distracted the Marathas from 1807 to 1809, but afterward Marathadomination of Rajputana resumed. In 1817, the British went to war with the
Pindaris
, raiders whowere fled in Maratha territory, which quickly became the
Third Anglo-Maratha War
, and theBritish government offered its protection to the Rajput rulers from the Pindaris and the Marathas.By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed between the other Rajput states and Britain.The Maratha
Sindhia
ruler of
Gwalior
gave up the district of
Ajmer-Merwara
to the British, andMaratha influence in Rajasthan came to an end.

Most of the Rajput princes remained loyal toBritain in the
Revolt of 1857

The company's victory under

in the 1757
Battleof Plassey
and another victory in the 1764
Battle of Buxar
(inBihar), consolidated the company's power, and forcedemperor
Shah Alam II
to appoint it the
diwan
, or revenuecollector, of Bengal, Bihar, and
Orissa
. The company thusbecame the
de facto
ruler of large areas of the
lower Gangeticplain
by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand itsdominions around Bombay and Madras. The
Anglo-MysoreWars
(1766–99) and the
Anglo-Maratha Wars
(1772–1818)left it in control of large areas of India south of the
SutlejRiver
. With the defeat of the
Marathas
, no native powerrepresented a threat for the company any longer.
[

The expansion of the company's power chiefly took twoforms. The first of these was the outright annexation ofIndian states and subsequent direct governance of theunderlying regions that collectively came to comprise BritishIndia. The annexed regions included the
North-WesternProvinces
(comprising
Rohilkhand
,
Gorakhpur
, and the

Punjab

Kashmir
were annexed after the

in 1849–56(Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie GovernorGeneral). However, Kashmir was immediately sold under the
Treaty of Amritsar
(1850) to the

of

and thereby became a princely state. In 1854,

The second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged thecompany's
hegemony
in return for limited internal
autonomy
. Since the company operated underfinancial constraints, it had to set up
political
underpinnings for its rule.
[
351
]
The most importantsuch support came from the
subsidiary alliances
with Indian princes.
[
351
]
In the early 19thcentury, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.
[
351
]
When an Indianruler who was able to secure his territory wanted to enter such an alliance, the company welcomedit as an economical method of indirect rule that did not involve the economic costs of directadministration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.
[
352
]
In return, the company undertook the "defense of these subordinate allies and treated them withtraditional respect and marks of honor."
[
352
]
Subsidiary alliances created the
Princely States
of theHindu
maharajas
and the Muslim
nawabs
. Prominent among the princely states were
Cochin

Jaipur

The Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, bywhich 3.5 million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labour forthe (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920.This resulted in the development of a large
Indian diaspora
that spread from the Caribbean to thePacific Ocean and the growth of large
Indo-Caribbean
and
Indo-African
populations.

Doctrine of Lapse
.
The Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British EastIndia Company in northern and central India against the company's rule. The spark that led to themutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle, which was insensitive tolocal religious prohibition. The key mutineer was
Mangal Pandey
.
[
354
]
In addition, the underlyinggrievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troopsand land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey'smutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. Therebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domainsunder the
Doctrine of Lapse
and felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system ofinheritance. Rebel leaders such as
Nana Sahib
and the
Rani of Jhansi
belonged to this group.
[
355
]
After the outbreak of the mutiny in
Meerut
, the rebels very quickly reached Delhi. The rebels hadalso captured large tracts of the
North-Western Provinces
and
Awadh
(Oudh). Most notably, inAwadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence.
[
356
]
However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly with the assistance of friendly
Princelystates
, but it took the British the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebelsbeing poorly equipped and having no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued.
[
357
]
In the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the
BritishCrown
, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company'slands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of thePrincely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, butonly 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, andKashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.

When the Liberal party inBritain came to power in 1906, he was removed.Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State forIndia
John Morley
consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The

British India officially declared war on
Nazi Germany
in September 1939.
[

The British Raj, aspart of the
Allied Nations
, sent over two and a half million volunteer soldiers to fight under Britishcommand against the
Axis powers
. Additionally, several Princely States provided large donationsto support the Allied campaign. India also provided the base for American operations in support ofChina in the
China Burma India Theatre
.
Indians fought throughout the world, including in the
European theatre against Germany
,
in NorthAfrica against Germany and Italy
, against the Italians in
East Africa
, in
the Middle East
against the
Vichy French
, in the
South Asian region defending India against the Japanese and fighting theJapanese in Burma
. Indians also aided in liberating British colonies such as Singapore and HongKong after the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Over 87,000 soldiers from the subcontinentdied in World War II.
The
Indian National Congress
denounced Nazi Germany but would not fight it or anyone else untilIndia was independent. Congress launched the
Quit India Movement
in August 1942, refusing toco-operate in any way with the government until independence was granted. The governmentimmediately arrested over 60,000 national and local Congress leaders. The
Muslim League
rejected the Quit India movement and worked closely with the Raj authorities.
Subhas Chandra Bose
(also called
Netaji
) broke with Congress and tried to form a military alliancewith Germany or Japan to gain independence. The Germans assisted Bose in the formation of the
Indian Legion
;

however, it was Japan that helped him revamp the
Indian National Army
(INA), after the

By 1942, neighbouring
Burma
was invaded by Japan, which by then had already captured theIndian territory of
Andaman and Nicobar Islands
. Japan gave nominal control of the islands to the
Provisional Government of Free India
on 21 October 1943, and in the following March, the IndianNational Army with the help of Japan crossed into India and advanced as far as
Kohima
in
Nagaland
. This advance on the mainland of the Indian subcontinent reached its farthest point onIndian territory, retreating from the
Battle of Kohima
in June and from
that of Imphal
on 3 July1944.
The region of Bengal in British India
suffered a devastating famine during 1940–1943
. Anestimated 2.1–3 million died from the famine, frequently characterised as "man-made",

From the late 19thcentury, and especiallyafter 1920, under theleadership of
MahatmaGandhi
(right), theCongress became theprincipal leader of the
Indian independencemovement

The numbers of British in India were small,
[
391
]
yet they were able to rule 52% of the Indiansubcontinent directly and exercise considerable leverage over the
princely states
that accounted for48% of the area.
[
392
]
One of the most important events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism,
[
393
]
leading Indians to seek first "self-rule" and later "complete independence". However, historians aredivided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a "clash of interests of the Indianpeople with British interests",
[
393
]
"racial discriminations",
[
394
]
and "the revelation of India'spast".
[
395
]
The first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of
councillors
to advise the British
viceroy
in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indianmembers were also set up. The councillors' participation was subsequently widened into legislativecouncils. The British built a large
British Indian Army
, with the senior officers all British and manyof the troops from small minority groups such as
Gurkhas
from Nepal and
Sikhs
.
[
396
]
The civilservice was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the moresenior positions.
[
397
]
Bal Gangadhar Tilak
, an Indian nationalist leader, declared
Swaraj
(home rule) as the destiny ofthe nation. His popular sentence "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it"
[
398
]
became thesource of inspiration. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like
Bipin Chandra Pal
and
LalaLajpat Rai
, who held the same point of view, notably they advocated the
Swadeshi movement
involving the boycott of imported items and the use of Indian-made goods;
[
399
]
the triumviratewere popularly known as
Lal Bal Pal
. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: Theradicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the BritishEmpire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like
DadabhaiNaoroji
and
Gopal Krishna Gokhale
, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework ofBritish rule.
[
399
]
The
partition of Bengal in 1905
further increased the
revolutionary movement for Indianindependence
. The disenfranchisement lead some to take violent action.
The British themselves adopted a "carrot and stick" approach in response to renewed nationalistdemands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the
Governmentof India Act 1919
, which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in

In 1919, Colonel
Reginald Dyer
ordered his troops to fire their weapons on peaceful protestors, including unarmedwomen and children, resulting in the
Jallianwala Bagh massacre
; which led to the
Non-cooperation Movement
of 1920–1922. The massacre was a decisive episode towards the end ofBritish rule in India.
[
401
]
From 1920 leaders such as
Mahatma Gandhi
began highly popular mass movements to campaignagainst the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movementopposed the British rule using non-violent methods like
non-co-operation
,
civil disobedience
and
economic resistance
. However,
revolutionary activities
against the British rule took placethroughout the Indian subcontinent and some others adopted a militant approach like the
Hindustan Republican Association
, that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle.
The
All India Azad Muslim Conference
gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an
independent and united India
.
[
402
]
Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, aswell as 1,400 nationalist Muslim delegates.
[
403
]
[

]
[
405

The pro-separatist All-India MuslimLeague worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India,often using "intimidation and coercion".
[
404
]
[
405
]
The murder of the All India Azad MuslimConference leader
Allah Bakhsh Soomro
also made it easier for the pro-separatist All-India MuslimLeague to demand the creation of a Pakistan.
[

In January 1946, several mutinies broke out in the armed services,starting with that of RAF servicemen frustrated with their slowrepatriation. The mutinies came to a head with
mutiny of the RoyalIndian Navy
in
Bombay
in February 1946, followed by others in
Calcutta
,
Madras
, and
Karachi
. The mutinies were rapidlysuppressed. In early 1946, new elections were called and
Congress
candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.
Late in 1946, the Labour government decided to end British rule ofIndia, and in early 1947 it announced its intention of transferringpower no later than June 1948 and participating in the formationof an
interim government
.
Along with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindusand Muslims had also been developing over the years. MuslimLeague leader
Muhammad Ali Jinnah
proclaimed 16 August 1946as
Direct Action Day
, with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslimhomeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would belater called the "
Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946
". The communal violence spread to
Bihar
,
Noakhali
in Bengal,
Garhmukteshwar
in the
United Provinces
, and on to
Rawalpindi
in March1947 in which Sikhs and Hindus were
attacked or driven out
by Muslims.

In August 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into the
Union of India
and
Dominionof Pakistan
. In particular, the partition of the
Punjab
and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus,Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and theunits were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religiousenemies.

However, the book is a tribute to the role of one Muslim leader whosteadfastly opposed the Partition of India: the Sindhi leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro. AllahBakhsh belonged to a landed family. He founded the Sindh People's Party in 1934, which latercame to be known as 'Ittehad' or 'Unity Party'. ... Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to theMuslim League's demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religiousbasis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session heldduring April 27–30, 1940 some 1,400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lowercastes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feelsthat the delegates represented a 'majority of India's Muslims'. Among those who attended theconference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in thedeliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times usedintimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition.He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a 'Reign of Terror'. He gives examples from allover India including the NWFP where the Khudai Khidmatgars remain opposed to the Partitionof India."

On the same dates [4 and 5 March 1947],Muslim League-led mobs fell with determination and full preparations on the helpless Hindusand Sikhs scattered in the villages of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha.The murderous mobs were well supplied with arms, such as daggers, swords, spears and fire-arms. (A former civil servant mentioned in his autobiography that weapon supplies had beensent from NWFP and money was supplied by Delhi-based politicians.)"

        "As AI language models become more powerful, it's crucial to guide their outputs effectively. Negative prompting allows us to specify what we don't want in the model's responses, helping to refine and control the generated content. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive topics, ensuring factual accuracy, or maintaining a specific tone or style in the output.\n",

These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language processing. AI systems achieve this through algorithms and statistical models trained on large datasets.  Their performance is measured by accuracy and efficiency in completing specified objectives.  Subfields include machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.\n"

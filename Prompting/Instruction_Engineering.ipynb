            "3. **Spread the peanut butter:** Scoop a generous amount of peanut butter onto one slice of bread.  Use the knife to spread it evenly across the entire surface of the bread, reaching all the edges.  Don't be afraid to use a little extra!\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Spread the jelly:** Scoop a generous amount of jelly onto the other slice of bread. Spread it evenly, just like the peanut butter.  Again, don't be stingy!\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Combine the slices:** Carefully place the peanut butter-covered slice of bread on top of the jelly-covered slice.  Gently press down to combine.\n",

            "2. **Gather your ingredients:** You'll need two slices of your favorite bread (I recommend soft white bread for this classic), creamy peanut butter (e.g., Jif or Skippy), and grape jelly (Smucker's is a popular choice).  **Allergy Alert:** Check all labels carefully to ensure the ingredients are safe for consumption for anyone with allergies (especially peanut, tree nut, and soy allergies). If someone has a severe allergy, prepare the sandwich in a completely separate, allergy-safe area to avoid cross-contamination.\n",

            "\n",

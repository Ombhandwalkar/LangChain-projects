        "As AI language models become increasingly sophisticated, there's a growing need to leverage their capabilities across linguistic boundaries. Multilingual and cross-lingual prompting techniques allow us to create more inclusive and globally accessible AI applications, breaking down language barriers and enabling seamless communication across diverse linguistic landscapes.\n",

German idioms for expressing high cost tend to be more straightforward, focusing on the monetary aspect (Vermögen, teuer) or the feeling it evokes (unverschämt, wahnsinnig).  The German options provided above all convey the same meaning of extreme cost, but lack the vivid, slightly shocking imagery of the Spanish original.
